    "bio": "I have a unique journey that led me from the fast-paced world of critical care nursing to the dynamic field of software engineering. With a background in both Emergency Room (ER) and Cardiac nursing, I honed my skills in high-stakes, life-saving environments. I developed a passion for problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. These qualities have been invaluable in my transition to the tech industry."
