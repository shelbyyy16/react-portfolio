    "bio": "I have a unique journey that led me from the fast-paced world of critical care nursing to the dynamic field of software engineering. With a background in both Emergency Room (ER) and Cardiac nursing, I honed my skills in high-stakes, life-saving environments. I developed a passion for problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. These qualities have been invaluable in my transition to the tech industry. I am currently also learning Graphic Design so I can increase the quality and visual appeal of my front-end web applications. In my (very limited) free time I am passionate about reading, trying new recipes and trying to keep my house plants alive.ðŸŒ±"
