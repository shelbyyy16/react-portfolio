    "bio": "I have a unique journey that led me from the fast-paced world of critical care nursing to the dynamic field of software engineering. With a background in both Emergency Room (ER) and Cardiac nursing, I honed my skills in high-stakes, life-saving environments. I developed a passion for problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. These qualities have been invaluable in my transition to the tech industry. The turning point in my journey was when I discovered the power of technology to enhance the patient experience and improve healthcare systems. I served as the Epic Systems Trainer to my unit where I was drawn to the creative and problem-solving aspects of software development and web design, which led me to take the leap and pursue a Full Stack Software Engineering education at General Assembly. My journey is a testament to the idea that career transitions are possible with determination and a commitment to learning. I'm excited to be a part of the ever-evolving tech world, where I can leverage my diverse experiences to create solutions that matter. In my (very limited) free time I am passionate about reading, trying new recipes and trying to keep my house plants alive.ðŸŒ±"
