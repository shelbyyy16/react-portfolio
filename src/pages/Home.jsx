      <p>
      I have a unique journey that led me from the fast-paced world of critical care nursing to the dynamic field of software engineering. With a background in both Emergency Room (ER) and Cardiac nursing, I honed my skills in high-stakes, life-saving environments. I developed a passion for <span className="highlight">problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to stay calm under pressure.</span> These qualities have been invaluable in my transition to the tech industry. The turning point in my journey was when I discovered the power of technology to enhance the patient experience and improve healthcare systems. I served as the Epic Systems Trainer to my unit where I was drawn to the creative and problem-solving aspects of software development and web design, which led me to take the leap and pursue a Full Stack Software Engineering education at General Assembly. My journey is a testament to the idea that career transitions are possible with determination and a commitment to learning. I'm excited to be a part of the ever-evolving tech world, where I can leverage my diverse experiences to <span className="highlight">create solutions that matter.</span>
